# Fabric Simulation
Simulation of net-like fabric made in Unity using Verlet Integration without any physics related build in functionalities<br />

### While Simulating:<br />
-`left click` on a point to drag it on the plane (either locked or unlocked)<br />

### While NOT simulating:<br />
-`right click` on empty space to create point<br />
-`left click` on a point to connect it with a previous point with a stick<br />
-press `escape` to delete previous anchor point (then left click on point to select new anchor)

### Both:<br />
-press `c` to clear the scene<br />
-press `space` to start/stop the simulation<br />
-hold `right click` and drag the mouse on sticks to cut them<br />
-`right click` on a point to lock/unlock it<br />
